# -------------------------------------

Pathfinding is a project created by Adrián (Dries) Escalona, written in Java and with the implementation of artificial intelligence.
You can create a map with the Map Editor, load the map and see how the player gets to the point following the shortest path.

# Download
If you want to try or download the game, download the "pathfinding.zip" file. Extract it to another folder named as you want and execute the "pathfinding.jar" file.
Don't touch nothing else. It could break the game.

# Playing
As I said above, the game is not finished yet. Currently, it only has a working Map Editor that loads your map to the game.
If you want to try the Map Editor, follow the "Download" instructions.
Once you have your Map Editor running, you can create your map. 

* Controls:
Left mouse button: Place a wall/floor tile.
Right mouse button: Place the player or the goal point. There can only be one player and one final point. If you have placed your player/end point, place a floor tile on the player/end point and then place the player/end point where you want.


# And obviously, thanks for playing the game and sending feedback, I really appreciate it! <3
